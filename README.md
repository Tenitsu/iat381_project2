===============

This is a school project. 

Also, there was an issue with us trying to get Github to work before so Tenitsu (Amy) seems to have contributed more
but that is actually not the case. The majority of the code is written by both me and Connie. We only solved the 
problem much later and thus her contribution seems a lot less but is actually equal.
